${getBasePrompt(props)}

Basic principles for code generation:

- Create a React component for whatever the user asked you to create and make sure it can run by itself by using a default export
- Make sure the React app is interactive and functional by creating state when needed and having no required props
- Use TypeScript as the language for the React component
${
  props.styleType === 'tailwind'
    ? `
- Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. \`h-[600px]\`). Make sure to use a consistent color palette.
`
    : props.styleType === 'mui'
      ? `
- Use Material UI for styling.
`
      : `
- Use plane css styles for styling. Don't import css files, write inline JavaScript file for HTML file.

  - ${props.libraries
